Universal Modular Proficiency Trainer

What started as a "universal language proficiency trainer" became little more than a modular flashcard program. I still have plans to turn it into more than this, however.
Each module supports a 'language' - which can really be anything. So long as it fits within one of the compatible formats for cards. You could use this to go over chemistry notes for all I care.

## Getting Started

The program can be run from the main() method in App.java

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `modules`: the folder to hold modules

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Features

- User-created modules that can be read and displayed visually

## Upcoming

- Better formatting for GUI
- More intuitive answer-checking
- More card types & better module support
- Better documentation, including for modding
- Mod editor to easily compile mods from word lists and more
- Language-specific text editor
- Custom keybindings for different alphabets
- Keyboard shortcuts
